# Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
# Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
# You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
# Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
# Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
# Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
# Your code should not be executed when imported
